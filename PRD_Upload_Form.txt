PRD v0.1 — Upload Form MVP (Images + PDF)

1. Purpose

Create the initial functionality for the project: allow the user to
select a photo (image) or PDF document (e.g., medical analysis scan) and
instantly display the file name on the page. No backend upload or
processing is required in this step. This feature also establishes the
base project structure.

2. Scope

-   A single web page with:
    -   Title: “Upload Analysis”
    -   File input (<input type="file" accept="image/*,.pdf">)
    -   Message area that shows: “You selected: <filename>”
-   Behavior:
    -   When the user selects a file, the filename is displayed
        immediately.
    -   If the selection is cleared or canceled, the message area is
        cleared.
    -   Only one file is supported at this stage.

3. User Story

As a user, I want to select an image or PDF file and immediately see its
name displayed, so that I know I chose the correct file.

4. UI/UX Requirements

-   Label is linked to the input (<label for="file">).
-   Message area uses aria-live="polite" for accessibility.
-   Works on desktop and mobile browsers.
-   Minimal CSS for readability; responsive layout.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

-   Frontend only: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).
-   Backend placeholder: Node.js + Express server to serve static files
    (no API yet).
-   Security: File is never uploaded, only the filename is displayed;
    escape special characters before showing in the DOM.
-   Performance: Instant response; no network calls.

6. Tech Stack

-   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla).
-   Backend (for static serving): Node.js + Express.
-   Environment: Local development, later deployable on VPS with Nginx +
    pm2.
-   Dependencies: Only express for backend.

7. Project Structure

    / (repo root)
    ├─ public/
    │  ├─ index.html        # Upload form page
    │  ├─ css/
    │  │  └─ style.css      # Minimal styles
    │  └─ js/
    │     └─ app.js         # File selection logic
    ├─ server/
    │  └─ app.js            # Express server serving /public
    ├─ .gitignore
    ├─ package.json         # Scripts: "dev": "node server/app.js"
    └─ README.md            # How to run locally

8. Acceptance Criteria

-   ☐ When an image or PDF is selected, the message “You selected:
    <filename>” appears below the input.
-   ☐ If selection is canceled, the message disappears.
-   ☐ Only the filename is shown (no path).
-   ☐ The file is not uploaded to the server.
-   ☐ The page opens at http://localhost:3000 after running npm run dev.

9. Test Cases

1.  Select a JPEG → filename appears.
2.  Select a PDF → filename appears.
3.  Select a second file (image or PDF) → filename updates.
4.  Cancel selection → message cleared.
5.  Long filename → displayed correctly without breaking layout.
6.  Keyboard navigation → file selection and filename display works.
